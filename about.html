                    <p>Hi, I’m Jillian McDonald, born and raised in Marietta, Georgia. I’m currently a third-year Information Technology student at Kennesaw State University. My passion for technology started at a young age and has only grown stronger as I’ve gained experience with various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                    <p>I’ve spent the last few years honing my skills in web development, focusing on creating responsive and user-friendly websites. My goal is to work with startups after graduation, using technology to solve real-world problems.</p>
                    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in IT. I look forward to a future where I can contribute my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in the tech world.</p>

                    <p id="extra-info" style="display:none;">I’m also interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning, and I’ve recently started experimenting with integrating AI into web applications. It’s an exciting field with a lot of potential!</p> <!-- Hidden info to display after click -->
